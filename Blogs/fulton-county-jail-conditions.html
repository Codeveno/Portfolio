      <p>The United States has reached a proposed consent decree to resolve claims that the conditions inside the Fulton County Jail violate constitutional rights and other federal laws. This action comes after an investigation by the U.S. Attorney’s Office and the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division revealed a pattern of inhumane and dangerous conditions in the facility.</p>

      <h2>Investigation Uncovers Serious Violations</h2>
      <p>The investigation, initiated in July 2023, found that the jail’s conditions were violating the 8th and 14th Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, as well as the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. The report highlighted issues such as unsanitary living conditions, inadequate medical care, and violent treatment of incarcerated individuals.</p>

      <h2>The Proposed Consent Decree</h2>
      <p>The proposed consent decree aims to address these systemic issues through a series of remedial measures. Among the key requirements are plans to ensure incarcerated people’s safety, improve staff supervision, and provide adequate medical and mental health care. Additionally, the decree calls for the establishment of a pest management system to maintain clean and sanitary conditions within the jail.</p>

      <h2>Addressing Vulnerable Populations</h2>
      <p>The agreement also targets vulnerable populations, such as people with mental health issues or disabilities. The use of isolation for those at risk of self-harm will be limited, and the jail is required to offer appropriate education services to incarcerated children with disabilities.</p>

      <h2>Independent Monitor for Oversight</h2>
      <p>To ensure accountability, an independent monitor will be appointed to assess the jail’s progress in meeting the decree’s requirements. Regular public reports will be issued every six months to provide transparency, and the public will be able to report concerns about the implementation of these reforms.</p>

      <h2>A Step Toward Reform</h2>
      <p>The proposed consent decree marks a significant step toward reforming the Fulton County Jail. U.S. Attorney Ryan K. Buchanan emphasized the importance of addressing the constitutional violations and improving the treatment of those in custody. The Department of Justice is hopeful that these changes will reduce violence, enhance medical care, and prevent further tragedies like the death of Lashawn Thompson, which brought attention to these critical issues.</p>

      <p>The case is ongoing, and while the proposed decree is subject to court approval, it represents a commitment to ensuring that the rights and well-being of those incarcerated are protected. The Justice Department remains dedicated to addressing violations in jails and prisons across the nation, aiming for a system that respects the dignity and rights of all individuals.</p>
