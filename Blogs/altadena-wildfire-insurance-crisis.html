      <p>The Eaton Fire that tore through Altadena, California, turned the home of Jeff and Jennifer Cohen into a shell of what it used to be.</p>
      <p>"I think there's some walls up, and it seems like the second floor collapsed onto the first, but I couldn't tell you if there's anything salvageable," Jeff Cohen said, looking at what remained of their home.</p>

      <h2>Facing a Financial and Emotional Burden</h2>
      <p>Getting the financial support to rebuild their lives will take time. Although the Cohens found temporary housing, their situation was worsened last September when they received a notice from their long-time insurance company. The notice informed them that their policy would not be renewed. Unfortunately, they are not alone in this struggle—over 100,000 Los Angeles homeowners had their insurance dropped before the latest wildfires struck.</p>

      <h2>Insurance Industry Grapples with Increasing Risk</h2>
      <p>When asked if the insurance company provided an explanation, Jeff Cohen said, "It's the fire hazard. It's a fire danger, you know? We were in an area that they couldn't provide insurance to any longer."</p>
      <p>This crisis is just the tip of the iceberg. Analysts predict that insurers may pay out more than $20 billion from the recent wildfire disaster alone, according to JPMorgan. As climate change continues to reshape risk landscapes, the insurance industry faces tens of billions of dollars in losses from natural disasters.</p>

      <h2>Innovative Risk Management: A New Approach to Disaster</h2>
      <p>Frances Moore, an associate professor at the University of California specializing in the economics of climate change, explains, "The kind of risk has been changing very quickly. Any healthy risk management, we really want the insurers to have an accurate picture of what that risk is." Risk assessment companies like Verisk have developed computer-generated catastrophic models to assess the likelihood and impact of such disasters.</p>
      <p>Verisk's models assess various factors, from climate conditions to local fire station availability and the infrastructure of the area. For example, Beverly Hills is marked with a deeper red color indicating higher loss potential due to fire ignition and spread rates. These models allow insurance companies to predict losses and set rates accordingly.</p>

      <h2>California's Changing Insurance Landscape</h2>
      <p>For many homeowners in high-risk areas, these models represent the future of insurance in wildfire-prone zones. California is lifting its long-standing ban on using such models to set insurance rates, marking a shift in how insurance companies will calculate premiums and manage risk in the state.</p>

      <h2>The Cohen's Search for Coverage</h2>
      <p>The Cohens eventually found insurance coverage, but only through a government-sponsored pool that comes with a much higher cost than their previous premium. Even that pool may not have sufficient funds to cover the anticipated claims from the Los Angeles fire damage.</p>

      <h2>Living in Limbo</h2>
      <p>Now, the Cohens face an uncertain future. Their home of 23 years has been reduced to ashes, and they are left to decide whether rebuilding in California is worth it. With mounting insurance costs and a shaky financial outlook, their once stable life has turned into a limbo of uncertainty.</p>

      <p>The story of Jeff and Jennifer Cohen is a stark reminder of how quickly things can change in the wake of natural disasters, and how the insurance industry’s role is evolving to keep up with the growing risks posed by climate change.</p>
